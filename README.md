# API Load Testing

This article will talk about how to load test your APIs. Load testing your APIs by simulating heavy traffic can help make sure that your API will be able to handle anything thrown at it!

Load testing your API means simulating heavy traffic coming into your API, and it can help you make sure that it is able to handle anything that is thrown at it. Start by identifying the different types of traffic that come in on an average day. The more specific you get about what type of traffic, the better, such as common business hours or if there are any seasonal variations.
